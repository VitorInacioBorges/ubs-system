## Development Methodology

### Layered Laravel Architecture

The backend is split into four main layers:

- **Controllers**: HTTP entry point and JSON serialization.
- **Services**: validation, application rules, and orchestration.
- **Repositories**: Eloquent queries and record creation.
- **Models**: table mapping, casts, fillable fields, and relationships.

This is not strict Clean Architecture because services depend on concrete repositories and repositories depend directly on Eloquent. It still improves responsibility separation compared to controllers that contain embedded business logic.

### Conventional Commits

The Git history shows Conventional Commits in Brazilian Portuguese:

```text
feat(services): valida ids e emails nas buscas
refactor(routes): aplica prefixo api pelo provider
docs(models): documenta hard delete nos models
```

### REST CRUD by Resource

The main resources use `Route::apiResource`, producing index, store, show, update, and destroy endpoints for each module. The additional `delete-self` route repeats deletion using an explicit `id`.

## State and Data Management

### Backend — Persistence

| Aspect | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **ORM** | Eloquent Models in `application/app/Models`. |
| **Model IDs** | Models use `HasUuids`, although the versioned `users` migration still uses `$table->id()`. |
| **Pagination** | Services normalize `per_page` into the 1 to 20 range. |
| **Casts** | `boolean`, `integer`, `date`, `array`, `float`, and native PHP enums. |
| **Migrations** | Loaded by Laravel from `database/migrations` and subdirectories. |
| **Test database** | In-memory SQLite configured in `phpunit.xml`. |

### Web Interface — State

The current views are rendered server-side with Blade. There is no global frontend state, SPA routing, or client-side authentication implemented in the versioned code.

### Client ↔ Backend Communication

| Aspect | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **API format** | JSON for REST controllers. |
| **Pagination** | `?per_page=N` query string, with an effective maximum of 20. |
| **ID validation** | UUID validation through `ValidateUtils::validateId()` for lookups, updates, and deletes by ID. |
| **Email validation** | `ValidateUtils::validateEmail()` used by email lookup in UBS and user services. |
| **Authentication** | No authentication middleware is applied to the current routes. |
