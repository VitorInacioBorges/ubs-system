# Prerequisites and Performance

## System Dependencies

### Runtime

| Dependency | Minimum version | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PHP** | `>=8.2` | `php -v` |
| **Composer** | `>=2.x` | `composer --version` |
| **Node.js** | Recommended `>=20 LTS` for modern Vite | `node --version` |
| **npm** | Compatible with the Node version | `npm --version` |

Versions observed while generating this documentation:

| Tool | Observed version |
| --- | --- |
| PHP | `8.3.6` |
| Composer | `2.7.1` |
| Laravel | `12.37.0` |
| Node.js | `24.14.0` |
| npm | `11.9.0` |

### Database

| Database | Project status | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PostgreSQL** | Default database in `.env.example` and `config/database.php`, following PDS-UEPG. | `psql --version` |
| **SQLite** | Used only for automated tests through `phpunit.xml`, when configured. | `php -m | grep sqlite` |
| **MySQL/MariaDB/SQL Server** | Default Laravel connections kept in `config/database.php`. | Corresponding client |

For new systems in the NTI/UEPG context, PostgreSQL is the project default database. SQLite remains only as an in-memory database for local automated tests.

### Relevant PHP Extensions

| Extension | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `pdo` | Database access through Laravel. |
| `pdo_pgsql` | Required for the default PostgreSQL connection. |
| `pdo_sqlite` | Required only for in-memory SQLite automated tests. |
| `mbstring` | Common Laravel and Symfony dependency. |
| `openssl` | Cryptography, keys, and secure operations. |
| `fileinfo` | File validation and handling. |

## Environment Requirements

Before running the application:

1. Install PHP dependencies with Composer.
2. Install JS dependencies with npm.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
4. Generate `APP_KEY`.
5. Configure PostgreSQL credentials.
6. Run migrations.

For automated tests, `phpunit.xml` already defines in-memory SQLite:

```xml
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
<env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
```

This in-memory database is appropriate for fast tests, but depends on migrations that match the models used by tests.
